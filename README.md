# basic-button-GUI
A simple GUI comprised of four buttons made using Java Swing Library and Java graphics.

# How it works:
Run Square.java from the program directory. The program should show four clickable buttons, three of them used for resizing the green frame and one that displays a greeting message.
# Getting an error:
Make sure the file you are trying to open is stored on your computer, preferably in the same directory as the program.
